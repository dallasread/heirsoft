        Choose trusted people. Each person will receive 2 keys (passwords). One is a "public" key and the other is "private".
    </li>

    <li>
        <em>All {{#if selected.keys.length > 2}}{{selected.keys.length}}{{/if}}</em> public keys are required to open the vault <em>every</em> time.
    </li>

    <li>
         Each person also needs a private key, which gives them access to ONLY the files they are permitted to see.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>
            To edit this vault in the future, you'll need to supply <em>all {{#if selected.keys.length > 2}}{{selected.keys.length}}{{/if}}</em> private keys. Record them in a safe place.
        </strong>
    </li>

    <li>
        To save your file for later, just click "Download Vault" and keep it in a safe place. You can upload it later to edit it. We save, collect, or record any of your data. <strong>All of your data is stored in your vault file.</strong>
