            <h2>
                Store personal notes, letters, and passwords in a secure, digital vault built on Open standards.
            </h2>

            <p>
                Heirsoft will bundle up all your files into a single vault that is <strong>encrypted by multiple passwords</strong> that you can share with loved ones. More details inside your vault.
            </p>

            <p>
                No login required because we don't store <em>ANY</em> of your information.
            </p>

                Note: The exported vault is built on Open cryptography standards. If, for some reason, you can't access Heirsoft.com, you will still be able to decrypt the vault's information (with the correct passwords). Information to decrypt the info is included at the top of the exported vault file (you will need at least a beginner understanding of cryptography).
